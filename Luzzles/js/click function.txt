click function on each language

inside of that click function 
	prevent default so it doesnt go to next page right away

	save a value in local storage for the language so...

	localStorage.setItem('language', 'arabic');

	go to url that the link points to



do the same thing on the category page except setting a local storage variable for 'category'	


whenever you go to the game page, you will want to get the value of the local storage things 


var language = localStorage.getItem('language');

var category = localStorage.getItem('category');
