	    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>   
	    
	    <div class="section1">
	    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
		    <p>I am a 3rd culture kid:</p> 
		    	<ul>
		    		<li>Lebanese ancestry...</li>
		    		<li>Born in NY...</li>
		    		<li>French educated.</li>
		    	</ul>
		    <p>So no, I don't really know what nationality to associate with, but I've got a few cultures (*cough* personalities *cough*) up my sleeves.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section2">
	    <h3>What do I want?</h3>
	    	<p>Everything and anything that will fuel my passion for traveling, meeting exceptional and unique people, learning new trades to cultivate my mental and physical being and spending as much time as possible trying new things so I don't have any regrets when I am 99 years old.</p>
	    </div>

	    <div class="section3">
	    <h3>Why 'Konspiring Kid'?</h3>
	    	<p>It's better than my other nickname : 'K*nty Kat' (due to my hangry moments and love for my cat). Otherwise, you'll always find me 'konspiring' innocently - but never in the way of any important tasks - and 'kid' because being a kid at heart is the best way to live in today's crazy society.</p>
	    </div>

	    <div class="section4">
	    <h3>What's next?</h3>
	    	<p>Does anyone f*cking know?</p>
	    </div>
